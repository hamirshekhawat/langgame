---

# üéÆ Game Design Section

## 1. Working Title
**Language Tiles** (placeholder): A relaxing tile-based language learning game.

## 2. Current Status
- **Status**: Design prototyping complete, first mechanics and core loops mapped.
- **Completed**: Learning loop, sentence-to-scene tile system, chapter progression structure.
- **In Progress**: UI prototyping, sentence tile design, first chapter vocabulary sets.
- **Issues**: Need to validate long-term engagement with real users.

## 3. Concept Statement
A peaceful, tile-based game where players build sentences in a foreign language to gradually assemble a beautiful, personalized world.

## 4. Genre
- Casual
- Language-learning
- Puzzle (light narrative)

## 5. Target Audience
- Casual learners of Chinese (beginner to intermediate)
- Ages 12+, educational or hobby interest
- Learners using mobile, tablet, or desktop

## 6. Unique Selling Points (USPs)
- Language learning through calm, low-pressure gameplay
- Tile-based sentence building that rewards comprehension
- Scene-building visuals that reflect vocabulary mastery
- Structured progression with sandbox rewards

## 7. Player Experience and Game POV
- **POV**: Top-down / 2D immersive view
- **Player Fantasy**: Build a tranquil world through language mastery
- **Emotions**: Calm, curiosity, pride, discovery
- **Player Role**: Learner, explorer, storyteller

## 8. Visual and Audio Style
- Soft pastel colors, flat tiles, minimalist scenes
- Ambient soundscapes (wind, birds, light music)

## 12. Core Loops
- Drag-and-drop sentence building (core loop)
- Successful sentence ‚Üí scene tile placement ‚Üí unlocks next challenge (progression loop)
- Optional: review mode ‚Üí XP and collectible tiles (long-term engagement loop)

## 13. Objectives and Progression
- **Short-term**: Complete a sentence, unlock tile
- **Medium-term**: Complete chapter scenes
- **Long-term**: Unlock and decorate sandbox world

## 14. Game Systems

> _Note: This section reflects the updated terminology where ‚ÄúSentence Tiles‚Äù are now ‚ÄúLanguage Tokens‚Äù and ‚ÄúScene/Decorative Tiles‚Äù are ‚ÄúWorld Tiles.‚Äù_

### ‚ú® Separated Systems Overview
To reflect the distinction between interactive language learning and world-building, the system is now divided into two main mechanics:

- **Language Token System**: Handles all interactive grammar and sentence construction.
  - Uses draggable **Language Tokens**
  - Tokens represent vocabulary or grammar structures (subject, verb, object, connectors)
  - Players build valid sentences using tokens in the sentence strip
  - Token feedback includes highlights, sound effects, and grammar validation
  - Grammar rules applied during validation phase

- **World Tile System**: Handles visual feedback and scene construction.
  - Uses **World Tiles**
  - Tiles are unlocked upon sentence completion or through creative placement
  - World Tiles are placed in a chapter grid or sandbox world
  - Certain tile configurations trigger discovery sentences and ambient animations

### Cross-Tile Ambient Animations
Visual events (e.g., birds, trains, breezes) that move across multiple tiles triggered by chapter milestones, completed sentence clusters, or sandbox arrangements. These animations enhance immersion and reward players with a sense of living, breathing progress.

- In **sandbox mode**, ambient animations serve as reactive elements based on tile arrangement. Example:
  - Train tiles placed adjacently ‚Üí train sprite animates across
  - Group of trees ‚Üí bird or wind animation
  - Lantern tiles ‚Üí floating lanterns at night
- Animations are non-blocking and low-intensity
- Triggered via tags, adjacency detection, or chapter milestones
- Implemented using tweening tools like LeanTween or DOTween

### Discovery Sentence Unlocks
These are special sentences unlocked not by direct instruction but by creative **World Tile** placement in both sandbox and chapter scenes.

- Unlocked by matching patterns (e.g., "tree" + "bench" + "lamp")
- Discovery Sentences:
  - Optional and visually distinct (e.g., glow border)
  - Not required for progression
  - Encourage experimentation and reinforce learned concepts
- When a discovery sentence is unlocked:
  - The sentence appears with audio/translation
  - **Associated tokens are also unlocked** (e.g., "ÈïøÊ§Ö", "ÂÖ¨Âõ≠", "Âùê") for reuse in review mode or sandbox construction
- Technical Implementation:
  - Each DiscoveryPattern includes `required_tiles`, `unlocks_sentence_id`, and optional `unlocks_token_ids`
  - Triggered via spatial detection algorithms or adjacency graphs

### Additional Systems
- Scene tile placement logic
- Sentence evaluation + feedback
- Progress tracking (by vocabulary, grammar category)
- Sentence tagging for grammar type (e.g., subject, verb, modifier, connector)
- Support for abstract grammar via multi-strip sentences and syntax helper tiles

## 15. Interactivity
- Drag-drop sentence tiles
- Click/tap for feedback, translations, pronunciation
- Hover: sentence replay, visual/audio tooltip
- Scene responds with soft animations (reward feedback)

## 16. Chapter Progression Map
- Chapter 1: Morning in the Park (greetings, preferences)
- Chapter 2: Afternoon at Home (objects, negation, adjectives)
- Chapter 3: Train Station (time, directions, transactions)
- Chapter 4+: Caf√© Lane, School Life, Market Day...

## 17. Sandbox Tile Placement Logic
- After completing Chapters 1‚Äì2, player unlocks Sandbox
- Each repeated sentence practice ‚Üí places aesthetic tile
- Player can arrange unlocked tiles freely

## 18. MVP Systems and Features
- Sentence tile builder
- Scene tile unlocker
- Audio + visual feedback system
- Chapter progression
- Sandbox unlock
- Review system with spaced repetition and mini-challenges

## 19. Game Objects
- **Language Tokens** (text-based sentence parts)
  - Nouns, verbs, connectors, modifiers
  - Dragged into sentence strip UI
- **World Tiles** (scene visuals)
  - Placed on grid map after sentence completion
  - Includes decorative and animated types
- **NPCs** (non-interactive or click-to-speak characters)
  - Trigger dialogue, hint grammar rules
- **Discovery Sentences** (unlockable)
  - Triggered by world tile patterns
  - Unlock new language tokens for future use

## 20. Localization
- Initial: Chinese ‚Üí English learners (Pinyin-based)
- Expandable to other L1-L2 pairs (e.g., Spanish ‚Üí English)

## 21. Tools
- Unity
- Google Sheets for vocabulary design
- Ink or Yarn (for dialogue trees, optional)

## 22. Technical Documentation
- Tile data stored as ScriptableObjects or JSON
- Sentence evaluation via string pattern matching
- Save data: local first, cloud optional
- Tile type metadata for grammar structure logic

## 23. Ideas and Expansions
- Add voice recognition
- Multiplayer cooperative scene building
- Seasonal themes (e.g., Mid-Autumn Festival)

## 24. Unresolved Questions
**[RESOLVED]**
- Best reinforcement system: use spaced review quests + dialogue puzzles post-Chapter 3
- Sentence-first unlocks preferred, with scene silhouette foreshadowing
- Abstract grammar supported via tile categories and multi-line sentence logic

## 25. Prototypes
- MVP in Unity: sentence tiles + scene tile appearing on success
- Testing tile placement and feedback polish

# üìö Glossary

**Language Token** ‚Äì A draggable unit of language (e.g., word, phrase connector) used to build sentences in the sentence strip UI.

**World Tile** ‚Äì A visual or animated object placed on the grid map to reflect progress or storytelling, unlocked through sentence completion.

**Discovery Sentence** ‚Äì A special sentence that is revealed when specific tile configurations are placed; often unlocks additional tokens.

**Ambient Animation** ‚Äì A non-blocking, visual animation triggered by the presence or arrangement of world tiles (e.g., birds flying over trees).

**Chapter** ‚Äì A themed level or unit of progression that introduces new vocabulary and sentence structures.

**Sandbox Mode** ‚Äì A freeform mode where unlocked tiles can be arranged creatively, often used for relaxation or reinforcement.

**Language Token Strip** ‚Äì The UI area where players build and validate sentences using draggable tokens.

**Review Mode** ‚Äì A practice feature that uses repetition and mini-challenges to reinforce learned sentences or grammar.

**Connector Token** ‚Äì A type of language token that joins sentence parts (e.g., ‚Äúbut‚Äù, ‚Äúand‚Äù, ‚Äúbecause‚Äù).
